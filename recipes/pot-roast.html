        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple recipe will teach you how to make the perfect pot roast for the whole family to enjoy.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>One 3- to 5-pound chuck roast</li>
            <li>2 or 3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 whole onions, peeled and halved</li>
            <li>6 to 8 whole carrots, unpeeled, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine, optional</li>
            <li>3 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 or 3 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 or 3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Generously salt and pepper the chuck roast.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the halved onions to the pot, browning them on both sides. Remove the onions to a plate.</li>
            <li>Throw the carrots into the same very hot pot and toss them around a bit until slightly browned, about a minute or so. Reserve the carrots with the onions.</li>
            <li>If needed, add a bit more olive oil to the very hot pot. Place the meat in the pot and sear it for about a minute on all sides until it is nice and brown all over. Remove the roast to a plate.</li>
            <li>With the burner still on high, use either red wine or beef broth (about 1 cup) to deglaze the pot, scraping the bottom with a whisk. Place the roast back into the pot and add enough beef stock to cover the meat halfway.</li>
            <li>Add in the onions and the carrots, along with the fresh herbs.</li>
            <li>Put the lid on, then roast for 3 hours for a 3-pound roast. For a 4 to 5-pound roast, plan on 4 hours. The roast is ready when it's fall-apart tender.</li>
        </ol>
